# stock-analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze stocks and determine which one would be the best to recommend to investors. Originally, the project only included a list of twelve potential stocks. The investors wanted to be able to use the same process to analyze the entire stock market. The code needed to be made more efficient to collect the same amount of data but in a shortened time frame.
