# stock-analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze stocks and determine which one would be the best to recommend to investors. Originally, the project only included a list of twelve potential stocks. The investors wanted to be able to use the same process to analyze the entire stock market. The code needed to be made more efficient to collect the same amount of data but in a shortened time frame. 
## Results

The refactored script is a success! As seen between the original times and the refactored times, the script runs very efficiently.

As seen in the images, the refactored code is about 150% faster to analyze 12 stocks for both years. To put this in perspective, if we were to run the original script for all 2,800 companies within the New York Stock Exchange it would take about 4 minutes more than the refactored script.
