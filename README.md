# stock-analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze stocks and determine which one would be the best to recommend to investors. Originally, the project only included a list of twelve potential stocks. The investors wanted to be able to use the same process to analyze the entire stock market. The code needed to be made more efficient to collect the same amount of data but in a shortened time frame. 

## Results

The refactored script is a success! As seen between the original times and the refactored times, the script runs very efficiently.

As seen in the images, the refactored code is about 150% faster to analyze 12 stocks for both years. To put this in perspective, if we were to run the original script for all 2,800 companies within the New York Stock Exchange it would take about 4 minutes more than the refactored script.

## Summary

###### Advantages

The first obvious advantage is that the refactored script runs faster. As mentioned within the result, imagine the time it would take to run an analysis of every publically traded company in the world or to analyze more than just the two years. Another advantage is the simplicity of the script, it isn't cluttered with potentially redundant code and is also easier to understand. Lastly, the refactored code is more efficient, using less processing power that can be better used on anothe project within a company.

###### Disadvantages
I can see the potential of excluding necessary code that may have been deemed redundant which could cause the results to be skewed or an error. Refactoring code can also introduce bugs that could completely break a script.

###### How the P's/C's Apply

The original code seems more cluttered than the refactored code, making it a lot easier to understand. Mostly due to my inexperience, while trying to refactor the original script, it seemed as if I was making things harder due to the many bugs I created.
